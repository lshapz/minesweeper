Welcome to my React/Redux implementation of Minesweeper! 


remaining todos:

  1) if you click on number and it has as many unclicked neighbors as you do remaining flags, flag those automatically ?? 

  2) restart button (technically handled by the form) 

  3) high scores? 

    top 15 all time each difficulty? (save to a Mongo somewhere)

    or per person: IP? / cookie or session? / make an account and persist forever?
