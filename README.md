Welcome to my React/Redux implementation of Minesweeper! 


remaining todos:

  1) if you click on number and it has as many unclicked neighbors as you do remaining flags, flag those automatically 

  2) timer 

    restart button ? 

  3) complexity options 

    probably needs its own reducer, or maybe part of gameReducer? 

  4) mineCount is kind of a hack, as is mine distribution in Gridmaker

  5) add instructions! 


bugs: 

  if you right click on a revealed square it changes the mineCount/flagCount
