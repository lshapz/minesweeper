Welcome to my React/Redux implementation of Minesweeper! 


remaining todos:

  1) if you click on number and it has as many unclicked neighbors as you do remaining flags, flag those automatically 

  2) timer 

    restart button ? - technically clicking a difficulty does this

  3) mineCount is kind of a hack, as is mine distribution in Gridmaker

  4) high scores?

    top 15 for each difficulty?

    or personal: IP based or cookie based or make account?
